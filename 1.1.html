    <h2>Generation 1 continuity family</h2>
    <h3>Marvel The Transformers comics</h3>
    <p><b>The Decepticons</b> emerged from the gladiatorial <i>State Games</i>, which caused <a
            href="https://tfwiki.net/wiki/Megatron_(G1)/Marvel_Comics_continuity">Megatron</a>'s rise to public
        prominence - in
        the aftermath of the destructive Vos-Tarn War, Megatron was able to use his fame and charisma to unite both the
        survivors and the planet's malcontents into a new army. His plan was to turn Cybertron into a mobile cosmic
        dreadnought and conquer the galaxy. State Games The Decepticons developed new technology to allow them to
        transform into attack vehicles and weaponry, launching a devastating attack that killed billions and shook the
        planet from its orbit before <a
            href="https://tfwiki.net/wiki/Optimus_Prime_(G1)/Marvel_Comics_continuity">Optimus Prime</a> turned the
        tide.
        <span>Megatron, Shockwave</span> and others were lost on Earth for four million years; as Optimus was too, the
        Autobots
        swiftly lost ground to Decepticon leaders Trannis and Straxus. Cybertron was devastated and conquered, causing
        the cream of the Decepticons to leave the burnt-out planet to form a Cybertronian Empire out in the stars, while
        Straxus threw all those he considered weak into the Smelting pool. The Empire would go on to slaughter and
        Cyberform planet after planet, their actions unknown on Cybertron.
        Eventually the Earth-bound Decepticons would awaken in 1984, sparking off a new front in the war. After the
        presumed suicide of Megatron, an escalation in fighting would see Decepticon leadership fragment and change
        hands rapidly, with frequent clashes, plots and counter-plots between the primary leadership, namely Starscream,
        Shockwave, Ratbat, and Scorponok, until most of them were killed in the Underbase conflict, leaving Scorponok
        the only surviving commander. A brief truce with the Autobots was held when Unicron attacked in 1991, but
        Scorponok was killed in the following conflict. Immediately after this, Bludgeon came to power. Charismatic and
        driven, Bludgeon turned the beaten Decepticons into a new army; after a defeat on Klo, they regrouped and
        reorganised. (In one reality, they were immediately massacred afterward.)

    <h4>Earthforce</h4>
    <p>In the side-continuity of <a href="https://tfwiki.net/wiki/Earthforce">Earthforce</a>, while Unicron continued on
        to Cybertron, Megatron and Shockwave continued a
        Decepticon civil war on Earth with a small handful of troops - wasting most of their time trying to take each
        other out. Eventually Soundwave and Starscream overthrew them, uniting both factions into a stronger Decepticon
        force. The two former leaders attempted to regain their position but never appeared to succeed.

    <h5>Marvel Generation 2 comic</h5>
    <p>Bludgeon invaded Earth with the intention of capturing the Matrix and making a new generation of Decepticons, but
        Megatron returned, killed Bludgeon in one-on-one combat, and stole this plan. However, the threat of the
        Cybertronian Empire forced an alliance between the Autobots and Decepticons again.</p>
    <h6>Regeneration One</h6>
    <p>Following Bludgeon's defeat on Klo, the Autobots turned their attention internally to Cybertron, repatriating
        Decepticons who chose to lay down their arms while leaving Bludgeon's faction free to conquer other planets and
        build up his Warworld. Having abandoned Earth to its own devices, the Autobots were unaware of Megatron's
        revival, and his subsequent devastation of the planet with the help of his horde of zombified Decepticons (which
        included a few Autobots in its ranks by circumstance). The horde was stopped when Optimus Prime killed Megatron
        once and for all.
        <br />
        <br />
        Meanwhile, Soundwave used the Decepticons on Cybertron to subvert the Autobots' peace, destroying the Last
        Autobot and clearing the way for Bludgeon's eventual return. In the interim, Scorponok launched his own covert
        invasion of Cybertron, with the intent of using his Gene Key to overwrite the CNA of every Autobot on the
        planet, turning them into Decepticons. Scorponok's efforts were ultimately thwarted by Grimlock, and Bludgeon's
        subsequent invasion was ultimately repelled by Rodimus Prime, but at the expense of leaving the Autobots
        virtually defenseless.
        While Rodimus led an Autobot task force on a preemptive strike against the Cybertronian Empire's Hub network,
        the Dark Matrix creature, which had manipulated events on Cybertron, Earth, and Nebulos, spread itself across
        Cybertron, turning every Transformer it could reach into Shadow-leeches. The last known surviving Decepticons
        were Ravage, Starscream, and Shockwave, who, facing extinction, renounced the ways of the Decepticons and became
        ambassadors for peace.
